# Dataset

The MNIST dataset is too large to put on github. It is not very essential to the code as a template for neural networks. 
For reference, in the project, the MNIST datasets were in a directory under the root project named Datasets. The two files were csv files: mnist_train.csv
and mnist_test.csv
